# RevenueCloudSubscriptionManagement
This repository is meant to contain simple examples of how the Subscription Management - Credit and Invoice Connect APIs can be consumed. There are readily usable templates ranging from scripts that will actively listen for platform events from the Salesforce org and publish them on Slack, to Writing a UI action button and Invocable Actions for these APIs.
